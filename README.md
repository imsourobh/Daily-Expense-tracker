<b>Personal Expense Tracker (Privacy-First)</b>

I built a Cyberpunk-themed expense tracker to manage daily finances without the cloud.

Key Features:

Total Privacy: Runs 100% on localStorage—your data never leaves your device.

Multi-Source Tracking: Manage Cash, Card, and Mobile Money (bKash/Nagad) in one place.

Debt Management: Track money given and received with automated balance logic.
